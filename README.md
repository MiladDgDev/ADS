Application Task

## Technologies Used

This project is built using modern web technologies to create a responsive tab/accordion interface. The core technologies include:

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page and defining the panels and buttons.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface, including responsive design that switches between tab and accordion modes based on screen width.
- **TypeScript**: For writing type-safe JavaScript code, handling user interactions, and managing the dynamic behavior of the panels.
- **JavaScript**: Compiled from TypeScript for browser execution.

Note: Animations were not added to save time, focusing instead on core functionality and responsiveness.

## IDE

The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a powerful and extensible code editor that provides excellent support for TypeScript, HTML, and CSS development. Key features utilized include:

- IntelliSense for TypeScript and JavaScript
- Built-in terminal for running TypeScript compiler
- Extensions for enhanced productivity (e.g., TypeScript support, live server for testing)
